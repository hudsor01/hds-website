# Milestone v1.0: Cleanup & Simplification

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 30+ plans executed via PRs #87-93, #96-101

## Overview

Transform a feature-complete Next.js business website from 130+ dependencies and scattered code patterns into a lean, maintainable codebase. Each phase systematically removed bloat while preserving working functionality (contact form, tool generators).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Dependency Audit & Pruning
**Goal**: Remove unused packages from 130+ npm dependencies
**Plans**: 5 plans
- [x] Audit Radix UI and UI libraries
- [x] Audit React Query, TanStack, Zustand
- [x] Audit tsx, sharp, vercel CLI
- [x] Audit Testing Library, MSW, Playwright
- [x] Final cleanup and verification

**Result**: Reduced 90 to 72 packages (20% reduction), zero regressions

### Phase 2: Dead Code Elimination
**Goal**: Remove orphaned components, unused functions, commented code
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [x] Remove orphaned components
- [x] Remove unused exports
- [x] Remove commented code
- [x] Final verification

**Result**: Removed 960 lines, reduced public API surface by 47% (62 to 33 exports)

### Phase 3: Integration Cleanup
**Goal**: Remove over-engineered integrations
**Plans**: 1 plan
- [x] Remove unused middleware and abstraction layers

**Result**: Removed 516 lines, simplified analytics by 58%, eliminated 5 wrapper files

### Phase 4: Code Deduplication
**Goal**: Consolidate duplicated logic
**Result**: Merged into other phases during execution

### Phase 5: Configuration Simplification
**Goal**: Extract hardcoded values, clean config files
**Plans**: 6 plans
- [x] Centralized constants
- [x] Env file cleanup
- [x] Config file audit
- [x] Route constants
- [x] Final verification
- [x] Full env integration

**Result**: Created centralized constants system, route constants, storage keys

### Phase 6: Component Structure Optimization
**Goal**: Remove unnecessary abstractions, flatten hierarchies
**Plans**: 5 plans
- [x] Remove duplicate components
- [x] Client/server optimization
- [x] Consolidate paystub components
- [x] Directory reorganization
- [x] Final verification

**Result**: Reorganized component directory structure (forms/, utilities/, calculators/)

### Phase 7: Build & Bundle Optimization
**Goal**: Tree-shake, reduce first load JS
**Plans**: 2 plans
- [x] Remove dead components
- [x] Remove unused dependencies

**Result**: Removed 3 dead components (372 lines), 3 unused deps (~55KB), fixed build

### Phase 8: Testing Infrastructure Review
**Goal**: Simplify testing setup, maintain coverage
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [x] Remove dead tests
- [x] Consolidate CSS tests
- [x] Optimize cross-browser testing
- [x] Final verification

**Result**: Reduced E2E code by 60% (~4,000 lines), CI speed improved 50%

### Phase 9: Documentation & Environment
**Goal**: Create .env.example, clean docs
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [x] Create .env.example
- [x] Remove stale docs
- [x] Update README
- [x] Final verification

**Result**: Created .env.example (135 lines, 18 vars), removed 1,624 lines stale docs

### Phase 10: Final Validation & Verification
**Goal**: End-to-end testing of all features
**Result**: 334 unit tests passing, TypeScript clean, lint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Aggressive dependency pruning (130+ to 72 packages)
- Standardized on TanStack ecosystem (Query, Form) + nuqs for URL state
- Removed Supabase auth middleware (unused)
- Simplified analytics from 5 wrapper files to direct implementation
- Reorganized components into forms/, utilities/, calculators/ directories

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed 83+ TypeScript errors from missing database types
- Resolved react-error-boundary 6.1.0 breaking type change (error: Error to unknown)
- Fixed all broken imports after component restructuring
- Eliminated all eslint-disable comments

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- database.ts remains at 6,286 lines (auto-generated, splitting not practical)
- @react-pdf/renderer incompatible with Turbopack (pre-existing, affects all branches)
- Test coverage gaps in analytics.ts (0%) and attribution.ts (0%)
