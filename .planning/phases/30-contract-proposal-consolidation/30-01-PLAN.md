<objective>
Consolidate contract and proposal generators by removing proposal-generator and keeping contract-generator as the primary document generation tool.

Purpose: Achieve target of 6 tools. Contract generator handles service agreements, NDAs, and freelance contracts - sufficient for business document needs.
Output: Reduced to 6 tools total.

**Prior Phase:**
Phase 29 complete - removed 7 low-value tools (~2,883 LOC removed).

**Decision:**
Keep contract-generator (recently refactored with new HTML template system) and delete proposal-generator. The contract generator already handles:
- Service agreements
- Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
- Freelance contracts

Proposal-specific features (pricing tables, milestones) are less commonly used and add maintenance burden.

**Final tool count after this phase: 6**
- paystub-generator
- invoice-generator
- contract-generator
- texas-ttl-calculator
- mortgage-calculator
- tip-calculator
