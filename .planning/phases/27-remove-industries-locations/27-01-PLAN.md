<objective>
Delete isolated industry and location pages with no cross-references - zero risk cleanup removing ~1,509 lines of unused code.

Purpose: First step in v3.0 Website Consolidation milestone - remove unused marketing pages that aren't linked from anywhere in the site navigation, sitemap, or other components.
Output: Cleaner codebase with 8 fewer files (5 industry pages, 2 location pages, 1 locations utility lib).

**Prior Phase Context:**
Phase 26 (Validation & Cleanup) completed v2.0 Backend Migration. All 342 tests passing, build succeeds. This phase begins v3.0 Website Consolidation milestone.

**Files to Delete (verified isolated - no cross-references):**
- `src/app/industries/` - 5 pages (~38 KB): saas, healthcare, fintech, real-estate, ecommerce
- `src/app/locations/` - 2 pages (~17 KB): index page, [city] dynamic route
- `src/lib/locations.ts` - ~8 KB: Texas location data (only imported by location pages being deleted)

**Verification Completed:**
- grep confirms no imports of `@/lib/locations` outside of locations pages
- No navigation links to /industries or /locations in Navbar, Footer
- No sitemap.ts entries for these routes
- Self-contained pages with no shared state or components

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete industries and locations directories</name>
  <files>src/app/industries/, src/app/locations/, src/lib/locations.ts</files>
  <action>
Delete the isolated pages and utility file using rm -rf:
1. Delete src/app/industries/ directory (5 industry pages)
2. Delete src/app/locations/ directory (index + [city] dynamic route)
3. Delete src/lib/locations.ts (Texas location data utility)

These files are self-contained with no cross-references - verified via grep before planning.
  </action>
  <verify>
ls src/app/industries 2>/dev/null || echo "industries deleted"
ls src/app/locations 2>/dev/null || echo "locations deleted"
ls src/lib/locations.ts 2>/dev/null || echo "locations.ts deleted"
  </verify>
  <done>All 8 files deleted: 5 industry pages, 2 location pages, 1 lib file (~1,509 LOC removed)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify build and tests pass</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Run type check and build to ensure no lingering imports or broken references:
1. Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass with no errors
2. Run `pnpm build` - should complete successfully
3. Run `pnpm test:unit` - all tests should still pass

If any failures occur, investigate for hidden dependencies missed during planning.
  </action>
  <verify>
pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && echo "Build successful"
  </verify>
  <done>TypeScript compiles, build succeeds, no broken references</done>
</task>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `ls src/app/industries` returns "No such file or directory"
- [ ] `ls src/app/locations` returns "No such file or directory"
- [ ] `ls src/lib/locations.ts` returns "No such file or directory"
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes with no errors
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds
- [ ] No grep results for `/industries` or `/locations` route references remain
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All 8 target files deleted
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Build succeeds
- No broken imports or references
- Ready for Phase 28 (Remove Resources Pages)
</success_criteria>
